# Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Set up your Python virtual environment
  - Make sure you're in the root directory of the repo
  - Create the virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
    - You should see a new folder called `venv`

3. Install the relevant packages
  - Make sure your virtual environment is activated
    - Run `source venv/bin/activate`
      - You should see `(venv)` appear on the Terminal prompt
    - Also check that `pip` is pointing to the instance from the venv, not from system:
      `which pip`
  - Install the packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
